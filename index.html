<p>Welcome to ShapPang; calculations, as complex as they really are.</p>

<p>ShapPang is a twinkle in the eye project for a battle-weary programmer, who has hand-coded the details of calculating quote line details just one too many times.</p>

<p>This library is essentially a way of integrating marked up calculations in a language created for the purpose, allowing non-developers to administer and change the way their software does core calculations without developer overview. This also allows developers to hand off the tedious job of checking that they've implemented the math as the client has "specified". /wearydeveloperrant</p>

<p>We're in the earliest of stages as yet (including getting used to GIT), so bear with us while we bootstrap the project some!</p>
